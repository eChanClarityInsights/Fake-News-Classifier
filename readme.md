### Introduction
A large chemical company keeps its employees up to date on news by compiling
a list of news articles to send to its staff. Recently, its news feed has been
infiltrated by fake news articles. I used AI and Natural Language Processing to
build a classifier to separate the genuine articles from the fake news articles.  

### Results  
I build a Naive Bayes model that was 99% accurate in predicting real and fake
news. I used over 600 real and fake news articles to train and validate the
model.    

### Contents
1. Modules - A custom cleaning module for preparing news articles for modeling.  
2. Notebooks - Contains three Jupyter Notebooks that I used to scrape news articles, read and clean the articles, and build a model.  
3. Saved Files - Intermediate files to save my progress
